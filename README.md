# awesome-directed-fuzzing

Directed Fuzzing seems to be a current hot research topic. This repository aims to provide a curated list of research papers focusing on directed greybox fuzzing (see more [directed whitebox fuzzing](./whitebox.md) and [miscellaneous](./misc.md)).

#### [arxiv'20] TOFU: Target-Oriented FUzzer [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14375.pdf)
- *Command-line flags*: TOFU augments the input space that it explores to include command-line flags, so that users do not have to select such flags manually.
- *Distance metric*: the number of correct branching decisions needed to reach the target, and does not use a complicated relationship to the history of the annealing that has taken place (e.g., min-max normalized values)
- *Input-structure aware*: TOFU leverages knowledge of the programâ€™s input structure in the form of a protobuf
specification.
